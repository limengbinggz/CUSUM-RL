# Testing Stationarity and Change Point Detection in Reinforcement Learning (CUSUM-RL)

This repository contains the implementation for the AoS paper "Testing Stationarity and Change Point Detection in Reinforcement Learning" in Python (and R for plotting).


## Summary of the paper

We consider reinforcement learning (RL) methods in offline nonstationary environments. Many existing RL algorithms in the literature rely on the stationarity assumption that requires the system transition and the reward function to be constant over time. However, the stationarity assumption is restrictive in practice and is likely to be violated in a number of applications, including traffic signal control, robotics and mobile health. In this paper, we develop a consistent procedure to test the nonstationarity of the optimal policy based on pre-collected historical data, without additional online data collection. Based on the proposed test, we further develop a sequential change point detection method that can be naturally coupled with existing state-of-the-art RL methods for policy optimisation in nonstationary environments. The usefulness of our method is illustrated by theoretical results, simulation studies, and a real data example from the [2018 Intern Health Study (IHS)](https://www.srijan-sen-lab.com/intern-health-study).

**Figure**: P-value over different values of kappa (the number of time points from the last time point). The discounted factor equal 0.9 and 0.95, from top plots to bottom plots. The specialties corresponds to emergency, pediatrics and family practice, from left plots to right plots.

## File Overview

- Folder `functions/`: This folder contains all utility Python functions used in numerical experiments including simulation and data analysis
    - `compute_test_statistics.py` implements the proposed CUSUM-RL test of nonstationarity.
    - `evaluation.py` implements the evaluation procedure. Specifically, it contains functions for estimating the optimal policy and estimating the value of the policy using fitted-Q evaluation.
    - `simulate_data_1d.py` generates data in 1-dimensional simulation. It contains functions to simulate data in 4 scenarios of different transition and reward functions.
    - `simulate_data_real.py` generated data in the IHS study simulation.

- Folder `simulation_1d/`: This folder contains the platform that realizes the 1-dimensional simulation in the paper. Numbers prefixing the names of the .py files indicate the order to realize the simulation scenarios. Files starting with a p in their names contain codes to generate plots in the paper. 
    - `01_sim_1d_run.py` simulates 1-dimensional data and test for nonstationarity on a specified time interval. Usage:

    ```sh
    bash run_sim_1d.sh
    ```
    - To run the 1-dimensional testing on a cluster and submit the simulation jobs using `slurm` by sample size, kappa, gamma, and data settings,
    ```console
    python submission_scripts/01_sim_submit.py
